# This is not-fully completed, there is some bugs i need to fix them 
# Few Bugs are :
1. While fetching the data from the API, if data not found then no data is printed on the output which i need to fix it.
2. I need to add more api's from the backup if any of the api fail to respond my query then i can requests from others.
3. I need to minimize the extra line of code and also i need to work on the UI.
